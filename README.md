# PennLabsProjectZero
Demo project for Penn Labs
This project demonstrates my ability to make a functional app in a short timespan (~ 4 hours). It pulls information regarding Penn dining hall hours from the PennLabs API (http://api.pennlabs.org/dining/venues), parses it into a meaningful format, and displays it to the user in an easy to navigate table. The user also has the option to select a specific dining venue, which opens a webview with more detailed information specific to that venue. I also implemented a gesture recognizer, so a swipe from the left to the right of the screen returns the user to the main page.

As a challenge, I decided to write this entirely programatically, without any using any storyboards. As a programmer who ususally uses storyboards, this was very difficult at first, but I definitely learned a lot from this experience. Because of this, my app certainly does not look as clean as it could, and does not implement as many features as I would have liked it to (no custom cells, no separation by type of dining venye), however I think it was worth it because I learned how to implement these features entirely in code. If I had more time, I would have implemented all of these, however I limited myself to four hours due to a variety of other obligations.
