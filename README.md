# PennLabsProjectZero
Demo project for Penn Labs
This project demonstrates my ability to make a functional app in a short timespan (~ 4 hours). It pulls information regarding Penn dining hall hours from the PennLabs API (http://api.pennlabs.org/dining/venues), parses it into a meaningful format, and displays it to the user in an easy to navigate table. The user also has the option to select a specific dining venue, which opens a webview with more detailed information specific to that venue. I also implemented a gesture recognizer, so a swipe from the left to the right of the screen returns the user to the main page.

As a challenge, I decided to write this entirely programatically, without using any storyboards. I definitely learned a lot from this experience. If I had more time, I would have used custom tableview cellsand separated the dining venues by category.
